Open questions:
---------------

[XML 1.0/1.1]
- XML 1.1 normalization - scope of applicability (seems inconsistent as 'relevant 
constructs' would apply to non-root element's attribute values, but not to root's
attribute values, or to comments/PIs inside the root element, but not at the top
level)
- Reserved xml namespaces - latest errata in 1.0 changed the reservation from
[Xx][Mm][Ll] to xml- in PIs and xml: in element and attribute names. There is
no similar errata in XML 1.1 spec.
