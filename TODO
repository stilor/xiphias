[Web content]
- http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/collation/codepoint has a broken link
to XPath 3.1 spec.

[XML 1.0/1.1]
- XML 1.1 normalization - scope of applicability (seems inconsistent as 'relevant 
constructs' would apply to non-root element's attribute values, but not to root's
attribute values, or to comments/PIs inside the root element, but not at the top
level)
- Reserved xml namespaces - latest errata in 1.0 changed the reservation from
[Xx][Mm][Ll] to xml- in PIs and xml: in element and attribute names. There is
no similar errata in XML 1.1 spec.
- For the purposes of attribute value normalization, does "no declaration has been
read" consider only declarations in DTD, or in other schema languages as well?
For example, if attribute xxx is declared with type xs:ID in XML Schema, should
an XML processor strip the leading/trailing spaces from its value in
`<a xxx=" 123 "/>`? From the definition in 5.1, it looks like validating against
XML Schema does not count as a "validation processor" - which seems kind of redundant
given that constraints on logical structure of the documents can be expressed
via XML Schema just as well.
