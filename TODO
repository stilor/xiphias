General:

Open questions:
- XML 1.1 normalization - scope of applicability (seems inconsistent as it
would apply to non-root element's attribute values, but not to root's attribute
values)
- Reserved xml namespaces - latest errata in 1.0 changed the reservation from
[Xx][Mm][Ll] to xml- in PIs and xml: in element and attribute names. There is
no similar errata in XML 1.1 spec.
